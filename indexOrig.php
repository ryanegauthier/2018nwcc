	                    <p class="lead">We are once again planning our 5th annual Hits for HOPE volleyball fundraiser put on by HOPE Worldwide to raise money for Sally's house and local community needs on August 20th,2016 at Valley Christian School. Last year, we raised over 15,000 dollars making it possible for us to help support Sally's house, the only emergency foster care program in Washington, providing CPS emergency foster care for children.  Some of the children have been abandoned, abused or neglected.  Others are victims of domestic violence.  Some lived with sex offenders, in drug houses, or their parents were arrested and taken to jail.</p>
